# cell_surface_map
This repo contains all the code for analysis of the cell surface proximity labeling data from the Bertozzi lab published in Floyd et al. Mapping the nanoscale organization of the human cell surface proteome reveals uncharacterized functional associations and surface antigen clusters. BioRxiv (2025). Code contains a focus on critical analyses included the unsupervised hierarchical clustering for functional domain analysis, the random forest classifier for predicting cell surface protein associations, and the strategy for making a 3D network heatmap.
